Using Flask, create a project that lists your top 5 favorite artists or sports figures. Your project should have the following features:

- A Home/index route
- A "Favorite 5" route


Your templates should be dynamic I want to see you guys inserting into your Templates using Jinja and looping through your top 5 items.



Your project should be structured as a package using the __init__.py that we discussed today.

Once you have completed the project, commit the project to github and submit the github link to this assignment.
